# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing argument labels**: Added `perform:` labels to `onAppear` and `onDisappear` modifiers
2. **Type mismatches**: Fixed `hasTrailersAvailable` expecting VugaContent instead of Episode
3. **Missing enum cases**: Fixed Image.proIcon â†’ Image.crown and String enum cases for premium/ad dialogs
4. **RatingView not found**: Changed to use RatingBottomSheet which is defined in the file
5. **Removed iOS 16+ modifiers**: Removed presentationDetents and presentationDragIndicator
6. **Fixed complex expression**: Refactored ContentDetailView into smaller computed properties

## Current Status

The main compilation errors have been fixed. However, you still need to:

1. Add `SubscriptionRequiredSheet.swift` to your Xcode project (see XCODE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. The app is using a simplified inline subscription sheet as a temporary workaround

## Warnings

There are some duplicate file warnings in the build system for:
- SubscriptionsView.swift
- TrailerPlayerView.swift  
- TrailerInlinePlayer.swift

These are just warnings and won't prevent the build.

## Next Steps

1. Open Xcode
2. Add SubscriptionRequiredSheet.swift to the project
3. Build and run the app
4. The font sizes have been increased by one throughout the app as requested
