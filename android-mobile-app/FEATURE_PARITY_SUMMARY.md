### 2. Profile Avatar Upload Functionality

**Files Added:**

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/retrofit/RetrofitService.java` - Added avatar upload/remove endpoints
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/utils/Const.java` - Added avatar-related constants

**Description:**
- Implements profile avatar upload to Digital Ocean Spaces (matching iOS functionality)
- Automatic image resizing and compression for optimal file sizes
- Base64 encoding for API upload
- Support for avatar removal (revert to color avatar)
- EXIF orientation handling for proper image rotation

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /profiles/avatar/upload` - Upload custom avatar
- `POST /profiles/avatar/remove` - Remove custom avatar

### 3. Subscription Management Features

**Files Added:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/model/SubscriptionModels.java`
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/activities/SubscriptionsActivity.java`
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/adapters/SubscriptionPlansAdapter.java`
- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_subscriptions.xml`
- `app/src/main/res/layout/item_subscription_plan.xml`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/retrofit/RetrofitService.java` - Added subscription endpoints

**Description:**
- Complete subscription management system matching iOS implementation
- Support for base subscriptions and distributor subscriptions
- Subscription plan display with pricing and billing periods
- User subscription status tracking
- Promo code validation support

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /subscription/plans` - Get available subscription plans
- `POST /subscription/my-subscriptions` - Get user's active subscriptions
- `POST /subscription/validate-promo` - Validate promo codes

### 4. Recently Watched API Integration

**Files Added:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/viewmodel/RecentlyWatchedViewModel.java`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/retrofit/RetrofitService.java` - Updated recently watched endpoint

**Description:**
- Updated Recently Watched functionality to use the same API endpoint as iOS
- Implements content ID-based fetching similar to iOS Core Data approach
- Includes duplicate removal and sorting by watch date
- Proper error handling and loading states

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /content/by-ids` - Fetch content details by IDs (matching iOS implementation)

## API Endpoint Standardization

All Android API endpoints now match the iOS implementation:

### Profile Management
- `/api/v2/profiles/{id}/avatar` - Avatar upload (via base64 data)
- `/profiles/avatar/upload` - Upload profile avatar
- `/profiles/avatar/remove` - Remove profile avatar

### Subscription Management
- `/subscription/plans` - Get subscription plans
- `/subscription/my-subscriptions` - Get user subscriptions
- `/subscription/validate-promo` - Validate promo codes

### Content Management
- `/content/by-ids` - Fetch content by IDs for Recently Watched

## Key Implementation Details

### Avatar Upload Process
1. User selects image from gallery
2. Image is resized to max 500px while maintaining aspect ratio
3. JPEG compression applied (70% quality)
4. Image converted to base64 string
5. Base64 data sent to API via POST request
6. Server stores image in Digital Ocean Spaces
7. Profile updated with new avatar URL

### Network Monitoring
1. Monitors network changes using Android ConnectivityManager
2. Tracks API response times to determine connection quality
3. Shows status alerts for poor connections
4. Provides speed testing capabilities
5. Auto-hides alerts for good connections

### Subscription Management
1. Fetches available plans from API
2. Displays base and distributor plans separately
3. Shows user's current subscription status
4. Handles plan selection and purchase flow preparation
5. Supports promo code validation

### Recently Watched Integration
1. Maintains local content ID storage (similar to iOS Core Data)
2. Fetches full content details from API using stored IDs
3. Removes duplicates and sorts by watch date
4. Provides real-time updates via LiveData

## Testing Considerations

To verify feature parity:

1. **Network Monitoring**: Test on various network conditions (WiFi, cellular, offline)
2. **Avatar Upload**: Test with various image formats, sizes, and orientations
3. **Subscriptions**: Verify plan fetching and user subscription status display
4. **Recently Watched**: Test content ID storage and API integration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Local Storage**: Implement proper local database (Room) for Recently Watched content IDs
2. **Payment Integration**: Add Google Play Billing integration for subscription purchases
3. **Offline Sync**: Implement offline data synchronization for profile changes
4. **Push Notifications**: Add subscription renewal notifications

## Dependencies

The implementation uses existing dependencies and follows current project patterns:
- RxJava for asynchronous operations
- Retrofit for API calls
- Glide for image loading
- DataBinding for UI
- SessionManager for user state management

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow existing code patterns in the Android app.
