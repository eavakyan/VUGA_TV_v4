### Profile Avatar S3 Upload to Digital Ocean Spaces

#### Issue Fixed
Profile photos were not being uploaded to Digital Ocean Spaces S3 storage. Instead, they were being saved locally on the server, which prevented them from being accessible across all platforms (iOS, Android TV, etc.).

#### Files Modified

1. **CreateProfileActivity.java** (`/app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/activities/CreateProfileActivity.java`)
   - Changed from multipart file upload to base64 image upload
   - Added `uploadAvatarImage()` method that converts image to base64 and sends to `/profiles/avatar/upload` endpoint
   - Updated to use the same S3 upload flow as iOS app

2. **ProfileAvatarController.php** (`/api-backend/public_html/app/Http/Controllers/Api/V2/ProfileAvatarController.php`)
   - Fixed to use `App\Models\V2\AppUserProfile` instead of `App\Models\Profile`
   - Added `formatProfileResponse()` method for consistent response format
   - Uploads images to Digital Ocean Spaces at path: `profile-avatars/[user_id]/[profile_id]/`

3. **RetrofitService.java** (`/app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/retrofit/RetrofitService.java`)
   - Already had the `/profiles/avatar/upload` endpoint defined
   - Uses base64 string for image data

#### Implementation Details

**Upload Flow:**
1. User selects image from gallery
2. Image is compressed and copied to cache directory
3. When creating/updating profile:
   - First create/update the profile with basic info
   - Then upload the avatar image to S3 via `/profiles/avatar/upload`
   - Image is converted to base64 string before sending
4. Server processes the image:
   - Decodes base64 data
   - Resizes to 500x500 square
   - Uploads to Digital Ocean Spaces
   - Returns CDN URL in response

**S3 Configuration (already in place):**
- Disk: `spaces` in `config/filesystems.php`
- Bucket: `iosdev` (development)
- Region: `nyc3`
- CDN URL: `https://iosdev.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/`

## Recent Changes (August 16, 2025)

### Profile Avatar Display and Initials Fix

#### Issue Fixed
1. Edit Profile page was showing color avatar with initials instead of the uploaded profile photo
2. Profile initials were only showing the first letter of the name instead of first letter of each word (max 2 letters)

#### Files Modified

1. **ProfileActivity.java** (`/app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/activities/ProfileActivity.java`)
   - Updated `setUserDetail()` method to properly check avatar_type == "custom" before showing profile image
   - Added separate CardView components in layout for image avatars vs color avatars
   - Added `generateInitials()` method that extracts first letter of up to 2 words from the profile name
   - Fixed visibility logic to show the correct avatar type based on profile settings

2. **ProfileAdapter.java** (`/app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/adapters/ProfileAdapter.java`)
   - Added `generateInitials()` method for consistent initial generation
   - Updated to use the new initials logic (first letter of up to 2 words)

3. **CreateProfileActivity.java** (`/app/src/main/java/com/retry/vuga/activities/CreateProfileActivity.java`)
   - Added `generateInitials()` method for preview display
   - Updated preview to show correct initials format

4. **activity_profile.xml** (`/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_profile.xml`)
   - Added separate CardView for profile images (`card_image_holder`)
   - Added separate CardView for color avatars with initials (`view_color_avatar`)
   - Both CardViews use 50dp corner radius for circular appearance

#### Key Implementation Details

**Avatar Display Logic:**
- Check `avatar_type` field: if "custom" and has `custom_avatar_url`, show the uploaded image
- Otherwise, show color avatar with generated initials
- Fallback to default user icon if no avatar data exists

**Initials Generation Algorithm:**
```java
private String generateInitials(String name) {
    if (name == null || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
        return "P";
    }
    
    String trimmedName = name.trim();
    String[] words = trimmedName.split("\\s+");
    
    if (words.length == 0) {
        return "P";
    } else if (words.length == 1) {
        // Single word - take first letter
        return words[0].substring(0, 1).toUpperCase();
    } else {
        // Multiple words - take first letter of first two words
        String firstInitial = words[0].substring(0, 1).toUpperCase();
        String secondInitial = words[1].substring(0, 1).toUpperCase();
        return firstInitial + secondInitial;
    }
}
```

**Examples:**
- "John" → "J"
- "John Doe" → "JD"
- "John Doe Smith" → "JD" (only first two words)
- "" or null → "P" (default)

#### API Integration
The app properly integrates with the ProfileController.php API which returns:
- `avatar_type`: "custom", "color", or "default"
- `avatar_url`: Full URL for custom uploaded images
- `avatar_color`: Hex color code for color avatars

#### Testing Notes
- Tested on Samsung phone over WiFi
- Profile photo uploads correctly without rotation
- Edit Profile page now properly shows uploaded photos
- Profile initials display correctly for various name formats
- Changes are backward compatible with existing profiles

## Build & Install Commands

```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on specific device (when multiple devices connected)
adb -s R5CY61Q3J4Y install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/Vuga-debug.apk

# Install on Samsung phone over WiFi (after connecting)
adb connect 192.168.1.230:5555

## Server Files to Deploy
When deploying to production, ensure these files are uploaded:
- `/api-backend/public_html/app/Http/Controllers/Api/V2/ProfileController.php`

## Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ Profile image rotation fixed (images no longer rotate 90 degrees)
- ✅ Permission handling for Android 13+ (uses READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)
- ✅ File size validation (increased to 10MB server-side)
- ✅ Profile avatar display priority (custom image > color avatar > default)
- ✅ Profile initials generation (shows up to 2 letters from first 2 words)
