# AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS

## BEFORE YOU START
1. Read CLAUDE.md for system architecture and compatibility requirements
2. This is a multi-platform system - changes affect iOS, Android Mobile, and Android TV apps

## WHILE WORKING
- Check CLAUDE.md compatibility matrix before changing any API endpoints
- Search all platform directories before modifying shared code
- Prefer client-side fixes over API changes for compatibility

## AFTER MAKING CHANGES
1. Update CLAUDE.md when you:
   - ✅ Add/modify API endpoints (update compatibility matrix)
   - ✅ Change data models (update Field Compatibility Requirements)
   - ✅ Fix bugs that reveal compatibility issues (update Known Issues)
   - ✅ Add features affecting multiple platforms (update Recent Changes)
   Format: Add entry with date to "Recent Changes & Issues" section

2. Append to docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md for:
   - ✅ ANY API endpoint changes
   - ✅ ANY data model modifications
   - ✅ ANY cross-platform features
   - ✅ ANY compatibility fixes
   Use the template provided in the file

## CRITICAL RULES
- NEVER remove fields from API responses
- NEVER change field types without versioning
- ALWAYS check which platforms use an endpoint before modifying it
- ALWAYS document breaking changes and migration paths

See CLAUDE.md for full documentation.
