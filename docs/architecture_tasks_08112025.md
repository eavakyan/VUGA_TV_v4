iOS Mobile App Architecture Review Report

  The mobile-developer agent has conducted a comprehensive review of the iOS mobile app and identified several architectural and code design
  deficiencies. Here's the detailed report:

  Critical Issues

  1. State Management Chaos
  - Multiple competing state management approaches (SessionManager singleton, @AppStorage, ObservableObject)
  - Duplicate sources of truth for user/profile data across different components
  - Race conditions possible between SessionManager.currentProfile and @AppStorage

  ###2. Massive View Files
  - HomeView.swift (1,071 lines) - violates single responsibility principle
  - ContentDetailView.swift (2,034 lines) - extremely large and unmaintainable
  - Complex nested ViewBuilders that are difficult to debug and modify

  ###3. Memory Management Concerns
  - Potential retain cycles in notification observers (inconsistent weak self usage)
  - URLSessionDownloadTask stored in dictionaries without proper cleanup
  - AVPlayer and YouTube WebView instances may accumulate without proper release

  ###4. Poor Error Handling
  - Many network calls fail silently without user notification
  - Inconsistent error handling patterns (some use callbacks, others have none)
  - Generic "Something went wrong" messages instead of specific error information
  - No retry mechanisms for failed requests

  Architectural Anti-patterns

  1. Excessive Singleton Usage
  - SessionManager.shared, BaseViewModel.shared, DataController.shared
  - Creates tight coupling and makes unit testing extremely difficult
  - Global state dependencies throughout the app

  2. Business Logic in Views
  - Network calls and data processing directly in view files
  - Views handling navigation logic instead of coordinators
  - Models containing UI presentation logic

  ###3. God Objects
  - SessionManager handles user data, settings, downloads, and caching
  - ContentDetailView manages too many responsibilities
  - NetworkManager handles both networking and data transformation

  ###4. Code Duplication
  - Similar UI components recreated instead of reused
  - Duplicate network calling patterns across ViewModels
  - Repeated validation and formatting logic

  Performance Issues

  ###1. Inefficient Rendering
  - Large lists without proper virtualization
  - Heavy image loading without optimized caching strategies
  - Excessive re-rendering in complex views

  ###2. Network Inefficiencies
  - No request deduplication (same request could be made multiple times)
  - Missing request cancellation in many places
  - Aggressive refresh patterns without proper throttling

  ###3. Memory Usage
  - Multiple high-resolution images loaded simultaneously
  - Downloaded video files not properly managed
  - No memory pressure handling

  Maintainability Concerns

  ###1. Poor Code Organization
  - Utilities folder contains mixed functionality types
  - Extention folder (typo) mixes different extension types
  - Models contain both data structures and business logic
  - No clear module boundaries

  2. Inconsistent Patterns
  - Mixed architecture patterns (MVVM with singletons)
  - Different navigation approaches used throughout
  - Inconsistent naming conventions

  3. Limited Testability
  - Heavy singleton usage prevents proper mocking
  - ViewModels tightly coupled to specific implementations
  - No clear boundaries between architectural layers

  Priority Recommendations

  ###High Priority (Critical):
  1. Consolidate state management to single source of truth
  2. Fix memory management issues in download and video playback
  3. Implement proper error handling throughout the app
  4. Break down massive view files into manageable components

  ###Medium Priority:
  1. Reorganize code structure into proper modules
  2. Implement dependency injection to replace singletons
  3. Create comprehensive unit test suite
  4. Add proper logging and analytics

  Low Priority:
  ###1. Fix naming conventions and typos (e.g., "Extention" â†’ "Extension")
  2. Optimize performance for large lists
  ###3. Create design system documentation
  4. Add accessibility improvements

  Conclusion

  The app shows signs of rapid development without sufficient architectural planning, resulting in significant technical debt. While functional, the
  current architecture will increasingly hinder development speed, team collaboration, and app stability as the codebase grows. A structured
  refactoring approach focusing on separation of concerns and consistent patterns is essential for the app's continued evolution.
