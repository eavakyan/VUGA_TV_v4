To fix the 404 error for the profile endpoints, you may need to run these commands on the server:

1. Clear route cache:
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan route:cache

2. Clear configuration cache:
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan config:cache

3. Clear application cache:
   php artisan cache:clear

4. If using OPcache, you may also need to restart the web server or clear OPcache.

Make sure the ProfileController.php file is uploaded to:
/app/Http/Controllers/Api/V2/ProfileController.php

And that the routes/api_v2.php file is also uploaded and includes the profile routes.
